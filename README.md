### Hello GitHub! ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹

My name is <b>Netanel Kozel</b>, I'm a fourth-year student pursuing a B.Sc in <b>Software Engineering.</b>

As a Full-Stack developer, I am eager to build secure cloud applications and continuously learn and grow in the field. I am passionate about exploring new technologies and improving my skills every day.

My expertise and favorite would be writing <b>Node.js</b> applications and microservices in the back-end side and <b>React.js</b> applications in the front-end. My stack includes various frameworks such as <b>Expressjs</b>, <b>Nextjs</b> and <b>Remix.</b>

For databases I mainly use non-relational databases such as <b>AWS</b>, <b>MongoDB</b> or <b>Firebase Firestore</b>, but I'm also familiar with <b>PostgreSQL</b> and <b>ORM</b> in <b>JS</b> and <b>TS.</b>

I'm also familiar with

* Java development, including the <b>Spring</b> framework for REST APIs
* Android development with both Java and Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose for building modern mobile applications.
* Prompt engineering with maximum utilization of <b>artificial intelligence</b>

I'm constantly seeking new challenges to enhance my skills. Learning and problem-solving aren't just tasks for me; they're my passion. 

I always push myself to think big and find innovative solutions. Whether it's contributing to a project or seeking areas for improvement, I'm committed to making a difference. ðŸ’¡ 

I'm doing my best to donate to the open-source community as much as I can and am looking to collaborate at some interesting full-stack applications ðŸ‘¯
